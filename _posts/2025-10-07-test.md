2.0 Objectives
The primary objectives for implementing the Product Analytics & Engagement Platform are to:
Empower Business Teams: Provide our Product, Marketing, and UX teams with self-service tools to analyze user behavior, reducing dependency on data and engineering teams and shortening the time from question to insight.
Gain Deep Behavioral Insights: Move beyond high-level metrics to understand the "why" behind user actions. This includes identifying friction points in key user journeys, understanding feature adoption, and discovering patterns in user behavior.
Enhance Application Stability and Performance: Proactively monitor, identify, and diagnose technical issues, including application crashes, errors, and performance bottlenecks, to ensure a seamless and reliable user experience.
Capture Qualitative User Feedback: Implement mechanisms to collect direct customer feedback through contextual surveys, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and other rating systems to complement quantitative behavioral data.
Drive User Engagement and Retention: Leverage insights to create personalized, real-time engagement campaigns (e.g., push notifications, in-app messages) that improve user conversion, satisfaction, and long-term loyalty.
Foster a Culture of Experimentation: Enable rapid, data-driven decision-making by equipping teams with A/B testing and remote configuration capabilities, allowing them to test hypotheses and optimize the user experience continuously.
3.0 Success Criteria
The success of this project will be measured by the achievement of new organizational capabilities. We will consider the implementation successful when our teams can demonstrate the following:
Self-Service Analytics: Product managers and marketers can independently and regularly answer their own business questions (e.g., build funnels, segment users, create dashboards) without filing a ticket with data or engineering teams.
Actionable Insight Generation: Teams can move beyond reporting on what happened to articulating why it happened, using the platform's tools to identify specific points of user friction and opportunity.
Continuous Optimization Workflow: Product teams are regularly and independently running A/B tests to validate hypotheses, leading to a measurable, data-informed product development lifecycle.
Proactive Technical Monitoring: Technical teams can use the platform to significantly reduce the time-to-diagnosis for crashes and performance issues by correlating them with user actions.
Personalized Engagement Capability: Marketing and product teams can successfully design, implement, and automate behavior-triggered communication campaigns directly within the platform.
4.0 Background and Current State
The Bank currently relies on a combination of general application performance monitoring and a centralized data warehouse. While useful, this setup presents several challenges:
Data Latency: Insights are often delayed due to ETL processes, preventing real-time decision-making.
Lack of Self-Service: Business teams (Product, Marketing) have a high dependency on data and engineering teams to answer critical questions, slowing down the innovation cycle.
Limited Behavioral Insight: Our current tools tell us what happened but lack the specialized features to help us understand user actions, friction points, and conversion drop-offs.
5.0 Scope of Work
The selected vendor will be responsible for providing a solution that includes, but is not to be limited to, the following:
Platform & Licensing: Provide access to a robust, secure, and scalable Product Analytics & Engagement Platform for on-premise deployment.
Implementation & Onboarding: Assist with the technical integration of the platform's SDKs into our iOS, Android, and Web platforms. This includes guiding the setup of initial events, user properties, dashboards, and reports.
Strategic Services & Use Case Implementation: Collaborate with our business teams to assess our key digital products. This includes leading workshops on data modeling for events, defining critical user funnels and journeys, and implementing a set of initial, high-value use cases on the platform.
Training: Provide comprehensive training for both technical and business users to ensure effective adoption and utilization of the platform.
Ongoing Support: Offer technical support, maintenance, and strategic guidance post-implementation.
6.0 Functional & Technical Requirements
Proposals must detail how the solution addresses the following core requirements, which are grouped into three key themes:
6.1 Part 1: Data Capture & Management
User & Session Analytics: Automatic capture of user sessions, device data (OS, version, model), location, and other standard metrics across all digital platforms.
Custom Event Tracking: Ability to define and track a wide range of custom events and user actions within the apps and websites without limitation.
Rich User Profiles: Ability to create persistent user profiles that aggregate all attributes and behavioral events for each user. The platform must support the ability to associate these profiles with a unique, persistent customer identifier provided by the Bank (e.g., from our CRM or core banking system), effectively linking anonymous behavior to known customers.
Crash, Error, and Performance Reporting: Real-time collection and detailed reporting of application crashes and technical errors, including stack traces, user context, and performance monitoring (e.g., ANRs, network latency).
SDKs: Provide well-documented, lightweight, and stable SDKs for iOS, Android, and Web (JavaScript). The SDKs must have a minimal and verifiable impact on application performance, CPU usage, and battery life.
6.2 Part 2: Analysis & Insights
Funnels Analysis: Ability to build and analyze multi-step funnels to understand conversion rates and identify user drop-off points.
Retention & Cohort Analysis: Tools to analyze user retention over time by grouping users into cohorts based on start date or specific behaviors.
Path & Flow Analysis: Visual tools to explore the most common paths and sequences of events that users take through the applications and websites.
Behavioral Segmentation: A powerful segmentation engine to group users based on their attributes, actions (or inaction), and sequences of behavior. Segments should be usable across all analysis and engagement tools.
Dashboards & Reporting: Customizable, shareable dashboards that allow for the visualization of key metrics and trends.
6.3 Part 3: Action & Engagement
Multi-Channel Messaging: Ability to create, target, and send push notifications and in-app messages to user segments.
Behavior-Driven Campaign Automation: A visual workflow builder to create automated, multi-step user journeys and campaigns triggered by user behavior (e.g., an onboarding sequence for new users, a re-engagement campaign for lapsed users).
A/B Testing: A framework for A/B testing user interfaces, features, and messaging to optimize for specific goals across mobile and web.
Surveys & Feedback (NPS, CSAT): Ability to create and trigger a variety of contextual in-app and on-site surveys, including Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction (CSAT), and open-ended feedback forms.
Remote Configuration: Ability for business teams to change app features, promotions, or UI elements remotely without requiring a new app store release or web deployment.
7.0 Non-Functional Requirements
Security & Compliance: As a financial institution operating in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the platform must adhere to the highest standards of data security and regulatory compliance. Proposals must explicitly detail compliance with the Saudi Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL) and all other relevant local security and regulatory requirements. In addition, please detail any international certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, GDPR compliance).
Deployment Model: The solution must be deployed fully on-premise within the Bank's own data centers in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Proposals must detail the technical requirements, architecture, and support model for an on-premise deployment. SaaS or Cloud-hosted solutions will not be considered.
